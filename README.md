# 🤔 Are You Dumb? — A Funny Tkinter Game

A playful little GUI game built with `customtkinter` for Python. The question is simple: **"Are you dumb?"** But answering it... that's the fun part 😄

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The app asks, *"Are you a dumb?"*
- Two buttons: **Yes** and **No**
- Clicking **Yes**: Confirms your answer with a cheeky "I knew it!"
- Clicking **No**: Makes the **No** button randomly move around the screen, teasing you!

## 🐞 Debug Mode

Tired of chasing the **No** button?

- Turn on **Debug Mode** from the menu:  
  `Options -> Turn on Debug Mode`
- Now you can click **No** like a boss.

## 🧼 Reset Option

Want to reset the whole game UI?

- `Options -> Reset` to bring it back to default
